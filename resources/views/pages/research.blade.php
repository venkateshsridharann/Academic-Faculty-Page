        <h2>VLSI DEVICES & PROCESSING</h2>
        <p>The current research topics are in the area of Reliability of High-K Dielectrics in nanoscale CMOS Devices on
            silicon or on high-mobility substrates. The Processing conditions of various High-K dielectrics like HfZrO
            or HfAlO varied to bring the EOT below 0.7 nm. The work involves extensive device characterization such as
            stress-induced threshold voltage shifts, NBTI, PBTI, SILC, TZDB, TDDB, interface states and low temperature
            characterization.
            Defect Characterization of Thin-film (CdTe) and Silicon Solar Cells is also part of our group's
            research.</p>

        <h2> VLSI Design</h2>
        <p>The VLSI Design research includes (i) A 256-Channel Correlator Design for Charge-Pump Detector (ii) A
            Synthesizable VHDL Model for Three Dimensional Hyperbolic Positioning System using GPS; (iii) On-Chip
            Implementation of Deadlock Avoidance in Wormhole Networks; and Transceiver design for sensors network.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Integrated Sensors</h2>
        <p>The other current topic is characterization and modeling of Three N-Type Implant Pinned Buried Photodetector
            using Charge Transfer Model for Ultra High Frame Rate Burst Image Sensors.
            Remote monitoring of chemical sensors using local transceivers.</p>
